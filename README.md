**NP-Complete** is desired to be a sci-fi rogue-like featuring some gameplay
elements from Unreal World, Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, and more (if we can get
them and they make sense).

NP-Complete uses [libTCOD](http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/) with a custom
wrapper -- feel free to steal [the wrapper](tcod/__init__.py) for your own use.

Please note that to run NP-Complete you will need some dynamic libraries --
details and instructions are available in the file [libtcod-needs-dlls.md](libtcod-needs-dlls.md)
